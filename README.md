[Ticket](https://github.com/TheNetsky/Microsoft-Rewards-Script/issues/275)

Thanks to your mention of the new interface, I was able to identify and fix the issue using GitHub Copilot.

Now, the page loads correctly, and the screen problem is gone.

For those who want to contribute, I’ve created a repository where I’ve uploaded the fixed file—since I’m not a collaborator yet, this will allow others to assist if needed [Here](https://github.com/LightZirconite/msn-rw/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

(Note there may still be issues depending on your setup or whatever but the issue is resolved)
